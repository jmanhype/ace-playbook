# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Reference: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

**Principle I: Self-Improving Code Quality**
- [ ] Component playbooks identified (which modules will maintain strategy bullets)
- [ ] Code quality metrics defined (helpful/harmful pattern tracking)
- [ ] Reflection triggers established (when to update playbooks)

**Principle II: Reflection-Based Testing**
- [ ] Test playbooks planned (contract/integration/unit separation)
- [ ] Execution feedback integration designed (how tests capture runtime signals)
- [ ] Red-Green-Refactor-Reflect cycle documented

**Principle III: Context-Aware UX**
- [ ] UX playbook reference points identified (which patterns to follow)
- [ ] User feedback loops designed (how to capture behavioral/explicit feedback)
- [ ] Consistency validation approach defined

**Principle IV: Performance with Continuous Optimization**
- [ ] Performance budgets established (latency, throughput, resource limits)
- [ ] Performance playbook categories identified (which optimization areas apply)
- [ ] Automated performance testing planned (execution-based feedback)

**Principle V: Modular Black-Box Architecture**
- [ ] Generator-Reflector-Curator roles assigned (which modules fill which roles)
- [ ] Interface contracts defined (input/output signatures with versions)
- [ ] Forward compatibility plan documented (versioning strategy)

**ACE Framework Compliance**
- [ ] Playbook storage locations determined (`.specify/memory/playbooks/[domain]`)
- [ ] Delta update mechanism planned (how incremental changes will be applied)
- [ ] Adaptation mode selected (offline/online/hybrid)

**Violations/Justifications**: [Document any principle deviations in Complexity Tracking table]

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
