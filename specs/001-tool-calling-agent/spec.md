# Feature Specification: Tool-Calling Agent with ReAct Reasoning

**Feature Branch**: `001-tool-calling-agent`
**Created**: October 16, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Tool-calling agent support with ReAct reasoning for multi-step workflows"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - RAG Application with Database Tools (Priority: P1)

A developer building a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application needs their agent to query multiple databases iteratively to find the right information. The agent should reason about which database to check next based on previous results, and learn which retrieval strategies work best over time.

**Why this priority**: This is the most common use case and addresses immediate user needs (Benito's use case). RAG applications are the primary driver for tool-calling agents in production environments.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing a multi-database query scenario and verifying the agent successfully retrieves information through iterative tool calls, delivering immediate value for RAG developers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user query requiring information from multiple databases, **When** the agent processes the query with available database tools, **Then** the agent iteratively calls the appropriate database tools and returns accurate results
2. **Given** a query similar to previous successful queries, **When** the agent executes with playbook context, **Then** the agent uses learned strategies to reduce the number of database iterations by at least 30%
3. **Given** a database returns no results, **When** the agent evaluates the observation, **Then** the agent reasons about alternative databases to try and continues the search
4. **Given** multiple tool calls have been executed, **When** the agent completes the task, **Then** the reasoning trace captures all thoughts, tool calls, and observations for reflection

### User Story 2 - Multi-Tool Workflow Agent (Priority: P2)

A developer needs an agent that can orchestrate multiple different types of tools (APIs, calculators, search engines) to complete complex tasks requiring several steps of reasoning and action.

**Why this priority**: Extends beyond single-domain RAG to general tool orchestration, enabling broader agent capabilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing a task requiring 3+ different tool types (e.g., search → calculate → format) and verifying successful completion with appropriate tool sequencing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a task requiring multiple heterogeneous tools, **When** the agent analyzes the task, **Then** the agent selects and executes tools in a logical sequence based on reasoning
2. **Given** a tool returns an error or unexpected result, **When** the agent processes the observation, **Then** the agent adapts its strategy and tries alternative approaches
3. **Given** the agent has completed 50+ tasks, **When** the playbook is analyzed, **Then** common tool-calling patterns are captured as reusable strategies

---

### User Story 3 - Tool Usage Learning and Optimization (Priority: P3)

A researcher or power user wants to analyze how the agent's tool usage patterns evolve over time, understanding which combinations of tools and reasoning strategies prove most effective for different task types.

**Why this priority**: Enables advanced analysis and optimization but is not required for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running a batch of similar tasks and verifying that playbook captures tool usage patterns and strategy improvements are observable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** 100+ completed tasks with tool usage, **When** analyzing the playbook, **Then** tool-calling strategies are organized by domain with success metrics
2. **Given** a new task in a learned domain, **When** the agent executes with playbook context, **Then** the agent's initial tool selections match proven patterns from the playbook
3. **Given** tools with different performance characteristics, **When** the playbook evolves, **Then** faster/more reliable tools are prioritized in learned strategies

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a tool call times out or fails? The agent must handle tool failures gracefully and either retry with different parameters or try alternative tools.
- What happens when the agent reaches maximum iterations without completing the task? The system must return partial results with reasoning trace showing what was attempted.
- What happens when no tools are applicable to the query? The agent must recognize this and provide a clear explanation rather than making inappropriate tool calls.
- What happens when multiple tools could solve the task? The agent should use playbook strategies to prefer tools with proven success rates.
- What happens when tool signatures change or tools become unavailable? The system must validate tool availability before execution and handle missing tools gracefully.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow developers to register custom tools (functions/callables) with the agent
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable agents to perform iterative reasoning where each iteration includes: (1) a thought about the situation, (2) a decision to call a tool or finish, (3) execution and observation
- **FR-003**: System MUST integrate tool-calling agents with the existing playbook system to inject learned strategies as context
- **FR-004**: System MUST capture complete reasoning traces including all thoughts, tool selections, tool calls, and observations
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow configuration of maximum iterations to prevent infinite loops using a hybrid approach: system-wide default (e.g., 10 iterations), with optional per-agent overrides, and optional per-task overrides (task-level takes precedence over agent-level, which takes precedence over system default)
- **FR-006**: System MUST support any task signature (input/output format) while maintaining tool-calling capability
- **FR-007**: Reflector MUST analyze tool usage patterns and identify which tool-calling strategies lead to successful outcomes
- **FR-008**: Curator MUST store tool-calling strategies in playbook with metadata about success rates, tool sequences, and applicable domains
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate tool availability and function signatures before allowing agents to call them
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide clear error messages when tool calls fail, including context about what was attempted

### Key Entities

- **Tool**: Represents a callable function or API that the agent can use. Key attributes include: name, description, input parameters, output format, and reliability metrics (success rate, average execution time).
- **Reasoning Iteration**: Represents one cycle of thought → action → observation. Includes: iteration number, thought content, selected action (tool call or finish), tool parameters (if applicable), observation result, timestamp.
- **Tool-Calling Strategy**: A playbook bullet that captures proven patterns for tool usage. Includes: applicable domain, tool sequence, decision criteria for tool selection, success metrics, example scenarios.
- **Agent Task**: The input query or problem to solve. Includes: task description, available tools, domain context, playbook strategies (injected from previous learning), maximum iterations allowed.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Agents successfully complete 90% of tasks that require 2-5 tool calls within the maximum iteration limit
- **SC-002**: For repeated similar tasks, agents reduce average tool iterations by 30-50% after learning from 20+ examples
- **SC-003**: Tool-calling strategies are captured in playbook within 3 task completions showing the same successful pattern
- **SC-004**: RAG applications using the tool-calling agent achieve query resolution in under 10 seconds for 95% of queries (down from 15-20 seconds with trial-and-error approaches)
- **SC-005**: Agents handle tool failures gracefully with 95% success rate in finding alternative solutions when primary tools fail
- **SC-006**: Developers can integrate custom tools and run their first successful multi-tool task within 30 minutes of setup

### Qualitative Outcomes

- Developers report that agents make "intelligent" tool choices that align with human reasoning
- Reasoning traces are clear enough for developers to understand why specific tools were selected
- Playbook strategies are reusable across different agent instances in the same domain

## Out of Scope *(optional)*

The following are explicitly NOT included in this feature:

- Automatic tool discovery from external APIs or documentation
- Real-time tool creation or modification during agent execution
- Distributed tool execution across multiple machines
- Tool access control and authentication (assumes tools are pre-authenticated)
- Cost optimization based on tool pricing (assumes tools are free or cost is not a factor)
- Multi-agent collaboration where multiple agents share tools

These may be considered for future enhancements.

## Assumptions *(optional)*

- Tools are synchronous and return results within reasonable timeframes (< 30 seconds per call)
- Tools are deterministic enough that similar inputs produce similar outputs
- Developers provide accurate tool descriptions that help the agent understand when to use them
- The existing ACE playbook system can accommodate tool-calling strategies without modification
- Tool functions are safe to execute (no malicious code or security risks)
- Each tool call is independent (no transaction management or rollback needed)

## Dependencies *(optional)*

- **Existing ACE Components**: Requires functional Reflector, Curator, and Playbook systems
- **DSPy Framework**: Depends on DSPy library for signature handling and language model integration
- **Existing Generator Infrastructure**: Builds on the current generator module architecture (where CoTGenerator exists)

## Non-Functional Considerations *(optional)*

### Performance
- Tool call overhead should add less than 100ms per iteration (excluding actual tool execution time)
- Playbook retrieval for tool-calling strategies should complete in under 10ms
- Agent initialization with tools should complete in under 500ms

### Reliability
- System should handle tool failures without crashing the agent
- Reasoning traces should be persisted even if the agent fails to complete the task
- Tool validation should prevent runtime errors from malformed tool signatures

### Usability
- Tool registration should require minimal boilerplate code
- Error messages should clearly indicate which tool failed and why
- Reasoning traces should be human-readable for debugging

### Scalability
- Support for 10-50 tools per agent without performance degradation
- Handle reasoning traces up to 100 iterations without memory issues
- Playbook should efficiently store and retrieve tool-calling strategies for 100+ domains
