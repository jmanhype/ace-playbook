Perform a gap analysis to identify potential issues and risks.\n- **Dry Run**: Conduct a simulated migration to test the process without affecting live systems. Verify data integrity, performance, and user experience. Address any issues identified during the dry run before proceeding.\n- **Final Switch**: Execute the actual migration according to the planned timeline. Monitor the process closely for any anomalies or errors. Ensure all stakeholders are informed and ready to handle any unexpected issues.\n- **Rollback**: Prepare a rollback plan in case the migration fails. Have a clear set of instructions and a team ready to revert to the previous state if necessary. Test the rollback plan thoroughly before the migration.\n- **Verification**: Validate the migrated data against the original source to ensure accuracy and completeness. Perform post-migration testing to confirm that all systems and applications are functioning correctly.\n- **Executive Sign-Off**: Obtain approval from senior management and relevant stakeholders to proceed with the final switch. Ensure all legal and compliance requirements are met and that all necessary documentation is in place.",
