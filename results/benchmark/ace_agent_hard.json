      "original_answer": "A data migration cutover plan should be outlined as follows:\n\n- **Discovery**: Identify the current state of the data, understand the requirements, and define the scope of the migration. This includes gathering all necessary data from stakeholders, defining the target environment, and assessing the feasibility of the migration.\n- **Dry Run**: Simulate the migration process without affecting actual data to ensure that the plan works as intended. This phase should include testing the migration process, verifying data integrity, and addressing any issues found during the simulation.\n- **Final Switch**: Execute the migration according to the plan. Ensure that all systems are prepared and that the migration is performed at the scheduled time. Monitor the process closely to ensure a smooth transition.\n- **Rollback**: Prepare for a failover scenario in case the migration fails. Have a rollback plan in place, including procedures for reverting to the previous system if necessary. Test the rollback plan to ensure it can be executed successfully.\n- **Verification**: Verify that the migration was successful and that the new system is functioning as expected. This includes checking data integrity, performance metrics, and user feedback. Address any issues found during verification.\n- **Executive Sign-Off**: Obtain approval from executives and key stakeholders to proceed with the migration. This includes providing them with a detailed report of the migration process, results, and any risks or issues encountered. Ensure that all concerns are addressed before finalizing the migration.",
